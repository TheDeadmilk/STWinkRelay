Hubitat variation of the STWinkRelay integration. Requires the associated [STWinkRelay.apk](http://wink.boshdirect.com/updates/files/STWinkRelay_0-2-1a.apk) to be installed and the Wink Relay to be rooted.

> Note that @adamkempenich added support for Child Devices in the Wink Relay, so you should now install both the `device.groovy` and `device-child.groovy` device drivers into Hubitat before running the discovery.
